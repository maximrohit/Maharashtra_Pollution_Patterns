may sound stupid:-
We have been asked to check the latest research work to get most updated information; 
we are also asked to validate if old studies have been igonred during literature review.
If we read the latest paper how will we know about the previous studies and if they are missed?  
How do we confidentially/comprehensivelly say that the previous studies are not ignored?

how pollution should be regulated.

The multivariate analysis employing correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), 
and cluster analysis (CA) resulted in establishing a correlation between different pollutants.
 The results obtained allowed classification of different monitoring stations on the basis of each of the four pollutants,
 revealing information about their sources and mechanisms, visualizing their spatial distribution, and monitoring their levels according to 
 the average annual limits established in the legislation.

## talk about population diistribution

The statistical methods used in this study were Pearson’s correlation coefficients, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (CA). The correlation coefficient is a statistic tool used to measure the extent of the relationship between variables, when compared in pairs. There are several types of correlation coefficients: Pearson’s correlation is a correlation coefficient commonly used in linear regression and has been used to measure the strength of relationships between the four air pollutants.

Herein, the application of statistical methodologies such as multivariate analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) or geostatistical analysis with ordinary kriging (OK) could be a very useful aid in their interpretation of air pollution data.

To identify the source locations of transported PM (SO2 emissions), a
trajectory ensemble method named Potential Source Contribution
Function (PSCF) (Hopke, 2016) was used to estimate of the conditional
probabilities of upwind areas being the source locations of the observed
pollutants

##################################
## Season wise impact
Monthly-averaged data were analyzed in the trend analyses. Seasonal average statistics of concentrations and the associated 75th and
99th confidence intervals calculated by bootstrapping the data (n =
200) are reported in Fig. SI3. Typical seasonal cycles with maxima in
the coldest months (Nov–Feb) and minima in the warmest period
(Jun–Sept) were found for pollutants mainly linked to combustion
(CO, SO2, and DC). Such cycles exist given: (i) increased emissions for
domestic heating during the colder months; (ii) lower mixed layer
heights and possibly strong thermal inversions during the winter, (iii)
generally lower winds speeds and increased precipitation particularly
snow that scavenges pollutants in winter, and (iv) reduced atmospheric
oxidants in shorter photoperiod months

######################
 Similar patterns of carbonaceous PM are already reported in Rochester (Rattigan et al., 2010,
2013; Wang et al., 2011a, 2011b) and are mainly shaped by: (i) the increased outdoor activity in summer (e.g., barbeques); (ii) the open
burning of leaves during late summer-autumn; and (iii) the increased
wood burning emissions with the onset of colder periods in autumn.
During the coldest months and possible snow cover, there is a preference for using natural gas over wood burning for domestic heating.
The nitrate seasonality is related to: (i) its equilibrium properties leading to being predominately gaseous at temperatures over 20 °C
(Schaap et al., 2004) and (ii) the decrease in sulfate production

Maximal O3 concentrations are more likely to occur during the
warmer months, when favorable meteorological conditions, enhanced
photochemistry, and availability of reactive organic precursors are++
more conducive to O3 formation (Fig. SI13).

############visualisation

Several well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and polar
systems are integrated into our system. We also develop various novel methods, including circular pixel bar charts embedded into
polar systems, enhanced parallel coordinates with S-shape axis, and weighted complete graphs

circular pixel bar charts??

Some novel techniques have been developed
to address special challenges posed by weather data. In particular, we
introduce circular pixel bar charts to detect correlations between wind
direction, wind speed, and other attributes. We demonstrate how vectors
and multiple scalar attributes in weather data can be effectively
visualized by polar systems with embedded pixel bar charts and tailored
parallel coordinates. The weighted complete graph is employed
to reveal the overall correlation of all data dimensions and to determine
the order of axes in parallel coordinates. Based on our system,
some interesting patterns have been detected by domain scientists and
valuable feedback about these visualization techniques is obtained.

polar systems with embedded circular pixel bar charts can only reveal
the relationship between five dimensions while only correlations
between attributes represented by neighboring axes can usually be detected
in parallel coordinates.
